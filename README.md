# Mobileapp_TreasuryServData
There are  two Android apps. The first app, named FedCash, takes as input a year or a date range
from an interactive user. This app uses a second app, named TreasuryServ, to access a database maintained
by the US Department of the Treasury.  After it receives the the siteâ€™s response to the query, TreasuryServ will return the requested nformation back to the FedCash app as the value returned from the API call.
